Number Wizard Game

Although it is completely coded with the OOP structure, it is not fully optimized (Inheritance could have been suitable) and i am aware of that but this is a project that i made in 15 minutes just for fun. 

Another work I did on the OOP structure is that it was created with a dictionary structure to prevent the entire file from being filled with if-else blocks for menu designings on console.

Usage:
Just run the start.py
